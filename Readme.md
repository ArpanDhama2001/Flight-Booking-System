# ✈️ Flight Booking System — Microservices Architecture

This project is a scalable, production-grade **Flight Booking System** built using a **microservices architecture**. It simulates real-world airline operations with modular, decoupled services for managing flights, bookings, API access, and user notifications.

---

## 📌 Overview

Each core domain is developed as an independent service:

| Service | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✈️ [Flight Service](https://github.com/ArpanDhama2001/Flight-Service) | Manages airports, cities, flights, and seat availability. |
| 📥 [Booking Service](https://github.com/ArpanDhama2001/Flight-Booking-Service) | Handles user bookings, payment timeouts, and publishes events. |
| 🚪 [API Gateway](https://github.com/ArpanDhama2001/Flight-API-Gateway) | Central entry point with authentication, rate limiting, and routing. |
| 📧 [Notification Service](https://github.com/ArpanDhama2001/Flights-Notification-Service) | Sends email confirmations using RabbitMQ consumers. |
